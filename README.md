# TypeScript Stock Buy/Sell Dashboard - demo

This repository contains two screens:

1. **Tab One Screen**:
   - This screen represents a market dashboard.
   - Users can view randomly generated stock prices and add them to a cart.
   - Stocks can be added to the cart by pressing the "Buy" button and removed by pressing the "Sell" button.
   - The total value of items in the cart is displayed.

   - It displays a list of users with their avatars, names, and email addresses.

Each screen is implemented in a separate TypeScript file (`index.tsx` and `two.tsx`) and styled using StyleSheet.
